        "description": "레오나르도의 미소는 프란체스코 델 지오콘도의 아내를 고결한 어머니로 나타내지만, 고대와 현대의 표현에서 볼 수 있는 먼 표현이나 거만한 표현은 없습니다. 그는 미소를 통해 모델의 내면을 드러내고 싶다. 이 표현은 초상화에서는 드물지만 레오나르도 이전의 작품, 예를 들어 안토넬로 다 메시나(Antonello da Messina)에서 발견됩니다. 이 미소는 또한 모나리자의 동시대 창작물인 루브르 박물관의 성 안나(Saint Anne)와 성 장 밥티스트(Saint Jean Baptiste of the Louvre) 등 예술가의 여러 신성한 작품에서도 발견됩니다. 레오나르도는 의심할 바 없이 얼굴에 아름답고 우아한 모습을 주기 위해 이 표현을 선택했을 뿐만 아니라 보는 사람과 즉각적이고 효과적인 의사소통을 만들기 위해 선택했습니다. 이 환영하는 미소는 그를 모나리자의 생각 속으로 초대합니다. 그러나 레오나르도는 원인을 밝히지 않고 자신의 감정만을 제시할 뿐입니다. 이 미소는 변칙적인 게임으로 해석될 수도 있습니다. Giocondo는 이탈리아어로 행복하다를 의미합니다. 따라서 La Gioconda는 미소가 자연스러운 상징인 행복한 여성입니다.",

        "title": "Girl with a Pearl Earring",
        "artist": "Johannes Vermeer",
        "year": 1664,
        "description": "A young woman looks over her shoulder at us. She holds her head slightly to one side, there is a gleam in her greyish-blue eyes, and her lips are slightly parted and moist. On her head is a turban that she has wound from two pieces of material, one blue and one yellow, and she is adorned with a pearl earring. It is from this oversized jewel in the middle of the composition that the painting derives its title. The painting provides a rich sample of every aspect of Vermeer’s virtuoso painting technique. The face is modelled very softly, not in great detail but with gradual transitions and invisible brushstrokes. The clothing is depicted more schematically and enlivened with small dots of paint suggesting reflected light – one of Vermeer’s trademark features. Even so, the artist has clearly indicated differences between materials – for instance between the white collar, painted in impasto, and the drier paint of the turban, for which he used the precious pigment ultramarine. But the most remarkable detail is the pearl. This consists of little more than two brushstrokes: a bright highlight at upper left and the soft reflection of the white collar on the underside. Seventeenth-century Dutch girls did not wear turbans. With this accessory Vermeer has given the girl an Oriental air. Images like this were known in the seventeenth century as tronies. Tronies are not portraits: they were not made in order to produce the best possible likeness of an individual. Although there would probably be a sitter, the point of a tronie was mainly to make a study of a head representing a particular character or type. Rembrandt had popularised tronies in Dutch art around 1630. He made dozens of them, often using himself as the model, sometimes wearing a remarkable cap or a helmet. The pearl is too large to be real. Perhaps the girl is wearing a pearl drop made of glass, which has been varnished to give it a matte sheen. Another possibility, of course, is that the pearl was a product of Vermeer’s imagination. Pearls – both real and imitation – were fashionable in the period from about 1650 to 1680. We often find them in paintings by Frans van Mieris, Gabriel Metsu and Gerard ter Borch. Girl with a Pearl Earring has been known to the general public only since 1881, when it was put up for auction at the Venduhuis der Notarissen in The Hague. On the viewing day it attracted the attention of the influential cultural official Victor de Stuers, who was there together with his friend and neighbour, the art collector A.A. des Tombe. Tradition has it that even though the painting had been badly neglected, De Stuers recognised it as a Vermeer. According to a different version of the story, the painting was too dirty to be properly appraised, and the painter’s identity only became clear later on, when the cleaning operation revealed his signature. Whatever the case may be, De Stuers and Des Tombe agreed not to bid against each other, and Des Tombe therefore acquired the painting for the negligible sum of two guilders plus thirty cents mark-up. Des Tombe’s collection, which included works by contemporaries as well as old masters, was open to visitors at his home, at Parkstraat 26 in The Hague. The future director of the Mauritshuis, Abraham Bredius, was the first to extol the virtues of Girl with a Pearl Earring when he saw it at Parkstraat in 1885: ‘Vermeer overshadows all the rest; the girl’s head, so superbly modelled that one is almost inclined to forget one is looking at a painting, and that single gleam of light, will alone hold your attention’. When he died, on 16 December 1902, Des Tombe turned out to have made a secret will bequeathing twelve paintings to the Mauritshuis, including Girl with a Pearl Earring.",

        "title": "The Sistine Madonna",
        "artist": "Raphael",
        "year": 1512,
        "description": "The commission: The Sistine Madonna was almost certainly commissioned directly by Pope Julius II. In July 1512 the Vatican received the news that the northern Italian town of Piacenza had joined the Papal States. It is assumed that this event prompted the Pope to commission the painting. The Sistine Madonna was intended for the monastery church of San Sisto in Piacenza, with which the Pope was associated on account of close family contacts. Raphael had probably already been completed the work by the time of the Pope's death in February 1513. The painting: The Sistine Madonna is one of the world's most famous Renaissance masterpieces. It depicts a vision appearing to saints in the clouds. In the centre of the picture the Virgin strides towards the earthly realm whilst holding the Christ Child in her arms. Out of the expanse of the heavens, intimated by the countless heads of angels painted in sky blue, she carries the Christ Child into the world. Pope Sixtus II, a martyr from the third century, kneels on the left-hand side of the picture, showing her the way. On the right-hand side is the meekly kneeling figure of St. Barbara, who also suffered martyrdom in the third century. These two saints were venerated at the high altar of the monastery church of San Sisto in Piacenza, which is why the artist included them in the painting. The two cute cherubs perching on the balustrade at the bottom of the picture were added by Raphael at the very end of the painting process, primarily for compositional reasons.",
